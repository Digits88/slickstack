<div class="notice notice-warning">
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Due to massive malware infections, we've had to immediately blacklist the <strong>Custom Sidebars</strong> plugin (by WPMU Dev), which was already slated to be disallowed due to being bad practice (it "hacks" your frontend layout using AJAX, which is very resource intensive and causes lots of JS conflicts). An alternative and best practice is only using WordPress widgets, and/or your theme's own layout options, to design sidebars.</p>

<p>Another plugin that was recently blacklisted due to malware was <strong>Social Warfare</strong>, and due to a history of poor coding we will be permanently disallowing that plugin. While we try not to endorse specific plugins, an alternative that seems to be well coded and loads quickly is called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mashsharer/" target="_blank">MashShare</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, another plugin that was blacklisted in the last 24 hours is <strong>WooCommerce Wholesale Prices</strong> (and related extensions) by Rymera Web, which was causing our clients database thrashing and even crashing. One client resulted in having 44,000+ cron jobs being added to their database due to such poor coding of these plugins. An alternative option from an agency that seems to have a generally good reputation for coding is offered by <a href="https://ignitewoo.com/woocommerce-extensions-plugins-themes/woocommerce-wholesale-pricing/" target="_blank">IgniteWoo</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for your understanding. We know how frustrating it can be to have to look for a new plugin during an emergency. Our goal is only "immediately" blacklisting a plugin when its causing serious malware, hacking, thrashing, crashing, or similar. Rather than have your website hacked, or data lost, or your site offline for several days or worse, our goal is to keep your server online and your business reputation as stable as possible (many hosting providers will simply shut off your site for days on end).</p>

<p>If you are running a "business critical" website, be sure to choose your theme and plugins from vendors with a strong reputation, which is the best way to avoid these types of issues. Generally speaking, find a "free" plugin on WordPress.org is not always the best choice, especially for WooCommerce sites. To view a list of currently (or future) blacklisted plugins, along with vendors that we do not recommend, please bookmark <a href="http://mirrors.slickstack.io/wordpress/blacklist.txt" target="_blank">this blacklist file.</a></p>

<p>Over time, this process will get easier and easier as our blacklist matures, and as the WooCommerce community grows. We will likely be adding a few WP Admin "shortcuts" soon as well, to make it easier to access important documentation.</p>
